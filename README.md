# Multiline-Shebang
from: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Multiline_shebang  Multiline shebang Multiline shebang is a draft programming task. It is not yet considered ready to be promoted as a complete task, for reasons that should be found in its talk page.  Simple shebangs can help with scripting, e.g., #!/usr/bin/env python at the top of a Python script will allow it to be run in a terminal as "./script.py".  Occasionally, a more complex shebang line is needed. For example, some languages do not include the program name in ARGV; a multiline shebang can reorder the arguments so that the program name is included in ARGV.  The syntax for a multiline shebang is complicated. The shebang lines must be simultaneously commented away from the main language and revealed to some shell (perhaps Bash) so that they can be executed. In other words, Polyglots.  Warning: Using a multiline shebang of the form #!/bin/sh ... exec ... !# will set the code's mimetype to text/x-shellscript, which creates problems such as Emacs treating the file as a shell script, no matter which language and file extension it really uses.
